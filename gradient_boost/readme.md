---
The following Jupyter notebooks and datasets correspond to different sources of similar data.
- orig = data that sourced from the Kaggle Competition the group originally used utilized for analysis.  This data was synthetically generated from a machine-learning model by the content corridinators for the cometition.  The analytical values for each 'wine' does not correspond to an actual wine reviewed by a person.
- red = Data sourced from a Portugese research group where data from red Portugese wine was reviewed by humans.
- white = Data sourced from a Portugese research group where data from white Portugese wine was reviewed by humans.
- red_white = Red and white data from the Portugese research group merged into one data set
- trainable = Dataset containing all valid training data.  This dataset contains all the data from the original Kaggle competition data, as well as the red and white wine data from the Portugese group
