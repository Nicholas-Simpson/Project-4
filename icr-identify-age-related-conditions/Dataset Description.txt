Dataset Description
The competition data comprises over fifty anonymized health characteristics linked to three age-related conditions. Your goal is to predict whether a subject has or has not been diagnosed with one of these conditions -- a binary classification problem.

Note that this is a Code Competition, in which the actual test set is hidden. In this version, we give some sample data in the correct format to help you author your solutions. When your submission is scored, this example test data will be replaced with the full test set. There are about 400 rows in the full test set.
